; Certain rooms contain enemies that reinitialize the game RNG: Hoppers, Dessgeegas, Beetoms, lavaquake rocks.
; However, if the room has a music track change, after initialization by the enemies the RNG continues 
; updating while the new track loads (though it is not used during that time). This would throw off the 
; enemy behavior if the randomizer has a track change when vanilla does not, or vice versa. To solve this, 
; we reinitialize the game RNG after the music has loaded, to match the RNG values of the vanilla game.
;
; The RNG value after music loading depends on the enemy type in the room, whether or not there is a music 
; track change (in vanilla), and whether or not there is lava/acid in the room. Given the amount of variables
; that go into this, we just use a table of RNG values by room and/or door (obtained by using a debugger
; and memory watch to see the vanilla RNG value at $05E5 when the music finishes loading, setting a breakpoint 
; at $82E112).
