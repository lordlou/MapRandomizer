; Fix the crash that occurs when you kill an eye door whilst a eye door projectile is alive
; See the comments in the bank logs for $86:B6B9 for details on the bug
; The fix here is setting the X register to the enemy projectile index,
; which can be done without free space due to an unnecessary RTS in the original code

;;; For an unknown reason, the save station we put in main street
;;; sometimes (circumstances unclear) spawn two detection PLMs
;;; instead of one. These PLMs are supposed to precisely detect
;;; when Samus is standing on the save. When Samus does, it looks
;;; for a PLM at the same coordinates as itself, which is normally
;;; the actual save station PLM.
;;; But when two detection blocks are spawn, it detects the other detection
;;; block as being the save, and the save station doesn't work.
;;; Therefore, we add an extra check on PLM type to double check it has
;;; actually found the save station PLM.

;;; hijack in detection block PLM code when samus is
;;; positioned correctly

; happen to occur in the vanilla game but can in the randomizer, for example due to a combination of 
; fast doors and longer room load time (from reloading CRE) in case we enter from Kraid's Room.
