; We have one beam door PLM type for each of the 4 directions. Different beam types 
; (Charge, Ice, etc.) share the same PLM. We constrain to having at most one beam door per room, 
; allowing us to reserve only enough tiles in VRAM for one beam type (and orientation) at a time, 
; which get loaded when entering the room. The beam type is also stored in $1F76 when entering
; the room, used to determine the collision reaction for opening the door.
;
; Unpause hook to reload beam tiles is in hazard_markers.asm (to avoid needing an additional hook)
