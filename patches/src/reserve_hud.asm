; New Reserve HUD Style
; Each reserve is represented with a two tile wide half tile high bar that shows energy progress per pixel

; Info for portability:
; - This patch uses four tiles to show the reserves. Adjust the "rhud" variables to choose which tiles to use.
; - There are several hooks in various places to help update the tiles in VRAM at right times.
; - $0A1A in RAM is used to store the previous reserve health, used to avoid unnecessarily updating reserve HUD.
; - Direct Page $C1 to $CE is used to store function arguments.
