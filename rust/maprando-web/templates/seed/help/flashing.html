        <p>This setting affects the graphical appearance of screen flashing, including lightning, escape sequence effects, boss damage, and the initial flash of Power Bomb explosions.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Vanilla</strong>: Screen flashing happens as in the vanilla game.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Reduced</strong>: Most large, sudden flashes are reduced to have a milder change in brightness, while still being noticeable. Caution is recommended for those with serious sensitivities to such effects, as the effectiveness of these changes is not guaranteed and may vary by individual.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        The full-screen flashing after Mother Brain phase 1 is an exception, being always removed regardless of which option is selected.
