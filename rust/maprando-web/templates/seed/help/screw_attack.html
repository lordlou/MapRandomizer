        <p>This setting determines how the Screw Attack animation appears:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Vanilla</strong>: The Screw Attack animation is always based on the Space Jump animation
              regardless of whether or not Space Jump is equipped.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Split</strong>: Screw Attack without Space Jump equipped is based on the spin-jump animation.
              Screw Attack with Space Jump equipped is based on the Space Jump animation.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The behavior of the vanilla game can be explained by the fact that the player was expected to obtain Space
          Jump before Screw Attack and never have a reason to unequip Space Jump. Hence the possibility of using Screw
          Attack without Space Jump was apparently overlooked or considered unimportant.</p>
