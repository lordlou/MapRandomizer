    <h3 class="my-3">Logic</h3>
    <p>The logic for Super Metroid Map Rando is based on the
    <a href="https://github.com/miketrethewey/sm-json-data/tree/master">sm-json-data</a> project. For details about
    how to interpret the JSON, see the documentation there. This page links to listings of strats by room and also by
    tech.</p>

    <h5 id="additional_information">Additional information</h5>
    <p>Work is still on-going on the logic. Some things to be aware of:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>More strats and tech will be added over time. The goal is that any useful strats that are humanly viable
    should eventually be put into the logic.</p>
    <li><p>Implicit tech (e.g. canTrivialMidAirMorph) are always in logic on all settings.
    <li><p>Ignored tech (e.g. canRiskPermanentLossOfAccess) are never in logic on any settings.
    <li><p>The difficulty tier shown for a strat in these pages is based on the most favorable situation for executing it,
    e.g. assuming unlimited resources, items, cross-room runway length, and obstacles being already cleared.
    The randomizer logic takes into account such situational details: just because a strat is listed as "Basic"
    in these pages does not mean it will necessarily be in logic on "Basic" settings in every situation.</p>
    <li><p>The tech pages only list strats that reference the tech directly or by a helper, but not by a dependency.
    For example, "canWalljump" does not list strats that require "canPreciseWalljump". This is to avoid cluttering the 
    lower-level tech pages with strats that more properly belong to higher-level tech pages.
    </p>
    </ul>
