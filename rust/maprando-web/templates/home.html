                    <li>Saves are fast. Save often, to avoid losing progress.
                    <li>Don't go a way you can't come back from, except as a last resort.
                    <li>Before giving up, check the spoiler map to see what the game intended.
                    <li>This game can be challenging. There is a community happy to help. Find us on

                <h3>How to not get stuck</h3>
                <p>Randomized maps can lead to tricky scenarios. The game should always be beatable, but there are 
                ways that you could get stuck. If selecting a difficulty higher than "Basic", it is recommended to
                take a close look at the list of tricks that are expected. If a trick is enabled that you don't know 
                about, the game could require it, making it seem as if there's no way to progress. You can disable any 
                trick if you don't want to do it.
                </p>
                
                <p>It is possible to get caught in places that you can't escape. For example, you could fall down through 
                crumble blocks or water without the items needed to get out. Learning to manage these risks is one 
                of the challenges of this randomizer. The game has features to make it less painful in case you do 
                get stuck, and to help you prevent getting stuck:
                </p>
                
                <p>
                <ul>
                <li>You can quickly reload your saves using the shortcut L + R + Select + Start.
                <li>If you save in an area you can't escape, you can load an earlier save by repeating the quick reload shortcut.
                <li>Hazard stripes appear on certain doors where the other side has an immediate risk of softlock or death.
                <li>The game logic won't expect you to go down a one-way for an item unless there is some way out <i>without</i> 
                using the item (though this could be by some other path that loops around).
