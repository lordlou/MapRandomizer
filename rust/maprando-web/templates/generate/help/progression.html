        <p>Item progression settings affect the rate at which the randomizer will place key items, and which locations
          it will place them in, within the constraints of the selected "Skill assumptions" above. Four presets are
          available:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Key items are placed generously: by the time 50% of items are obtainable, at
              least 75% of key items should be obtainable. Morph, Bombs, and an ETank are placed early. Key items have no
              specific tendency to be in harder or easier locations to reach. Beams, additional tanks, and ammo are
              spread out uniformly. Multiple progression options are generally possible from relatively early in the
              game.</p>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Tricky</strong>: Key items are spread out at a roughly uniform pace but tend to be placed in
              harder-to-reach locations. Beams, tanks, and ammo are spread out uniformly as filler. Multiple progression options
              are generally possible by the middle of the game.</p>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Technical</strong>: Key items are delayed and tend to be placed in harder-to-reach locations.
              Tanks and certain beams (Charge, Wave, Spazer) are spread out as filler. Access to ammo other than
              Missiles is often delayed. A single progression sequence may be forced until late in the game. </p>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Challenge</strong>: Key items are delayed similarly to "Technical", but access to tanks is often delayed.
              Charge and Spazer are the only beams placed as filler. A single progression sequence may be forced until
              late in the game. </p>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Desolate</strong>: Some key items may not be placed at all, and the amount of ammo and tanks is
              greatly reduced. A single progression sequence may be forced through almost the entire game. </p>
        </ul>
        <p>For players new to this randomizer, the "Normal" preset is highly recommended. The "Tricky" preset and higher
          settings tend to make the game significantly more difficult. The "Technical" setting is recommended for players
          who want to be forced to learn new techniques to progress. Be careful selecting "Challenge" or "Desolate"
          settings as these can be fairly punishing: they are likely to require the player to go without Energy Tanks
          for much of the game.
        </p>
        <p>"Item progression" and "Skill assumptions" synergize with one another: harder item progression settings
          increase the likelihood that harder techniques selected in the "Skill assumptions" will actually be required
          to beat the game.
        <p>The item progression settings can be customized by clicking the gear icon on the right. Note that selecting
          a preset again will override any customized selections.
