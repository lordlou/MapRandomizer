        <p>Item progression settings affect the rate at which the randomizer will place key items, and which locations
          it will place them in, within the constraints of the selected "Skill assumptions" above. Three presets are
          available:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Key items are placed generously: by the time 50% of items are obtainable, at
              least 75% of key items should be obtainable. Morph and an ETank are placed early. Key items have no
              specific tendency to be in harder or easier locations to reach. Beams, additional tanks, and ammo are
              spread out uniformly. Multiple progression options are generally possible from relatively early in the
              game.</p>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Tricky</strong>: Key items are spread out at a roughly uniform pace but tend to be placed in
              harder-to-reach locations. Beams, tanks, and ammo are spread out uniformly. Multiple progression options
              are generally possible by the middle of the game.</p>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Challenge</strong>: Key items are delayed and tend to be placed in harder-to-reach locations. A
              single progression sequence may be forced until late in the game. Access to tanks and ammo other than
              Missiles is often delayed.</p>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Desolate</strong>: Some key items may not be placed at all, and the amount of ammo and tanks is
              greatly reduced. A single progression sequence may be forced through almost the entire game. </p>
        </ul>
        <p>For players new to this randomizer, the "Normal" preset is highly recommended. The "Tricky" preset tends to
          make the game quite a bit more difficult. For "Challenge" and "Desolate" it can be much, much more difficult.
        </p>
        <p>"Item progression" and "Skill assumptions" synergize with one another: harder item progression settings
          increase the likelihood that harder techniques selected in the "Skill assumptions" will actually be required
          to beat the game.
        <p>The item progression settings can be tweaked by expanding the "Customize" section below. Note that selecting
          a preset again will override any customized selections.
