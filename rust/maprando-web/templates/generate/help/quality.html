        <p>These options help provide a smoother, more intuitive, and less tedious game experience. Several presets are
          provided:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Off</strong>: All quality-of-life options are turned off. This is for players who want a full
              experience of exploration, with a similar feel to the original game. This may involve a lot of wandering
              around and backtracking to figure out where to go. Map stations are harder to find and provide minimal
              assistance as all item dots look the same.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Low</strong>: Many quality-of-life options are turned off, restoring some unintuitive but
              potentially interesting vanilla game behavior: some items do not spawn until defeating Phantoon or waking
              the planet, Acid Chozo statue requires Space Jump to use it, and completing the escape may require
              collecting certain items and/or carefully managing energy in the Mother Brain fight. Map stations are
              somewhat less powerful because all ammo and tank items appear as small dots the same as Missiles.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Default</strong>: Quality-of-life options are turned to their generally recommended settings
              (mostly on). Map stations are very useful, with different item dot shapes to distinguish three tiers of
              items: Missiles, other ammo/tank items, and unique items. Enemy drops are somewhat improved, reducing the
              need for long farms. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>High</strong>: Map stations reveal even more information: ammo items (Supers and Power Bombs) are
              shown with a a small "X" while Energy Tanks and Reserve Tanks are shown with an "O". Map stations also 
              reveal area connections in neighboring areas, showing how they connect back to the current area. Energy
              stations and E-Tanks also refill reserve energy, and E-Tanks can be disabled.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Max</strong>: All quality-of-life options are turned on to their highest settings. This includes
              respin, lenient Space Jump, and momentum conservation to more fluidly control Samus, and an extra-fast
              Mother Brain fight that completely skips the second and third phases. Energy can also be manually
              transferred back into reserve tanks.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Individual options may be customized by clicking the gear icon on the right.</p>
