        <p>This setting determines where Samus begins the game:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ship</strong>: Samus begins in Landing Site at the Ship.</li>
          <li><strong>Random</strong>: Samus begins in a random room somewhere on Zebes.</li>
          <li><strong>Escape</strong>: Samus begins in Mother Brain Room at the start of the escape sequence.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>If "Random" start is used, generally Samus will not be able to save or refill at the starting location. The
          player will need to find the Ship in order to complete the escape sequence. In some cases, reaching an initial
          save station could be challenging, though the quality-of-life option "Guaranteed early save station" limits
          how bad it could be.</p>
        <p>With the "Escape" option, Samus will start with all items, and all that is required to beat the game is to
          make it back to the Ship in time (possibly after saving the animals). Save stations do not work during the
          escape, but map stations do. This option can be combined with the "Maps revealed from start" option (under
          "Other options"); otherwise it will likely take many escape attempts in order to find the Ship.
        <p>By clicking the gear icon on the right, it is possible to select a custom start location, among all locations
          used in the pool for "Random" start. Depending on the difficulty and other settings, some custom start locations
          may cause the randomizer to fail to generate a seed.
        </p>    
        <h5>Details</h5>
        <p>For Random and custom start locations, the logic selects an associated "hub" room, often a source of
          energy and other resources. The logic follows certain rules with respect to this hub room (similar 
          to how the Ship is treated when not using randomized start):
        <ul>
          <li>There is a logical path, starting with full resources (e.g. 99 energy), from the starting room to the hub and back without needing to collect items.
          <li>Items are only in logic once there is a path from the hub to the item and back without using the item, starting with empty resources (1 energy and no ammo).
          <li>The hub room is shown as the starting and ending point of routes in the spoiler map.
        </ul>
