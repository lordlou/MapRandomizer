        <p>This setting affects how strongly the randomizer follows the item priority settings in placing key items:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><b>Moderate</b>: The randomizer will usually prioritize placing "Early" items early and "Late" items
              late, but not always.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>Heavy</b>: The randomizer will always prioritize placing "Early" items early and "Late" items late,
              only selecting an item with later priority when no other choice provides progression.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h5>Details</h5>
        <p>With the "Moderate" setting, at the start of each seed generation attempt, the randomizer randomly shuffles
          the list of key items, with two copies of "Early" and "Late" items being included: for "Early" items,
          whichever copy occurs earlier is kept, while for "Late" items, whichever copy comes later is kept, to
          determine the item priority order.</p>
        <p>With the "Heavy" setting, the "Early" items are shuffled among themselves, "Default" items are shuffled among
          themselves, and "Late" items are shuffled among themselves; these three lists are then concatenated together
          to determine the item priority order.
