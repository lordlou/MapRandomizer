        <p>This setting affects which items will be treated as filler items:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><b>No</b>: The item is not treated as filler. This means it will only be placed if it is placed as a key
              item (e.g. if it helps provide progression), or at the end of item placement when the remaining items are
              placed.</p>
          <li>
            <p><b>Semi</b>: The item is not initially treated as filler. Once the first instance of the item is
              obtainable, additional instances become filler on subsequent steps.</p>
          <li>
            <p><b>Yes</b>: This item is treated as filler. This means it is mixed into the pool of items, along with
              Missiles, to fill up item locations on each step, without regard to whether it provides progression.</p>
          <li>
            <p><b>Early</b>: This item is treated as filler, and one instance of the item will be prioritized to be
              placed as early as possible.</p>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Filler items are randomly mixed in with Missiles to fill up the remaining obtainable item locations on each
          randomization step (ones not already being filled by key items).
        <p>For example, assuming Power Bombs are not selected as a filler item, then the game will only place the first
          Power Bomb pack as a key item (providing progression), but afterwards it will randomly mix the remaining Power
          Bomb packs in with the Missiles even if they don't provide further progression.</p>
