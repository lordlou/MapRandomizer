        <p>This setting affects the quantity of key items that the randomizer places on each step:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Fast</strong>: Key items are placed at double that of a uniform rate, concentrating them in
              locations accessible earlier in the game. By the time 50% of items are obtainable, at least 75% of key
              items should be obtainable.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Uniform</strong>: Key items are placed at a uniform rate. By the middle of the game there will
              likely be many possible ways to progress.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Slow</strong>: At most one key item is placed at each step. This tends to limit the player to a
              linear progression sequence, with many key items not being accessible until near the end of the game.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Details</h5>
        <p>With a Uniform progression rate, on a given step, the proportion of item locations to fill with key items (as
          opposed to filler items) is targeted to match the fraction of key items among all unplaced items; in other
          words, the amount of key items to be placed is roughly equal to the expected (average) amount if items were to
          be drawn completely randomly from the pool of unplaced items.</p>
        <p>On Slow progression, on each step the randomizer will first attempt to place zero key items, in case the
          filler items alone may be sufficient to provide progression. If that fails, it will try placing one key item.
