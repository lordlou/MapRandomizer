      <p>In the vanilla game, some items do not spawn until certain conditions are fulfilled:
      <ul>
      <li>Items in Wrecked Ship rooms (with the exception of the one item in Wrecked Ship Main Shaft) do not
      spawn until after Phantoon is defeated, when the rooms change to appearing "powered on".
      <li>The item in the left side of Morph Ball Room and in The Final Missile do not spawn until the planet is awakened.
      <li>The item in Pit Room does not spawn until entering with Morph and Missiles collected.
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>These conditions are apparently unintended artifacts of how the game was coded and are not normally 
      observable during casual play of the vanilla game. However, they can frequently be observed in the randomizer, which
      can be counter-intuitive for players. When this quality-of-life option is enabled, these items will spawn from the beginning
      of the game instead of requiring those conditions.</p>

      <h5>How to awaken the planet</h5>
      
      <p>Whether or not this option is enabled, the way to awaken the planet is same as in the vanilla game: it is done by 
      unlocking any gray door that requires killing enemies in the room (not including bosses). In the randomizer currently there are 
      four rooms where this can be done: 
      <ul>
      <li>Pit Room (old Mother Brain room)
      <li>Baby Kraid Room
      <li>Metal Pirates
      <li>Plasma Room
      </ul>
      Note that in order to awaken the planet using the Pit Room, the player must enter the room with Morph and Missiles, 
      otherwise the enemies and gray doors would not spawn.
      </p>

      <h5>Additional Notes</h5>

      <p>Other vanilla effects of defeating Phantoon and waking the planet are unaffected by this option, including:
      <ul>
      <li>After defeating Phantoon, the Bowling Alley Chozo statue becomes usable and there are changes to enemy spawns. This includes
        the Workrobot which will move and open access to the item in Wrecked Ship East Super Room.
      <li>After the planet is awakened, enemies will spawn in Parlor, Climb, Morph Ball Room, and Blue Brinstar Energy Tank Room.
      </ul></p>
