      <p>This removes the ability to wall jump from the game.</p>
      <p>This setting is taken into account in the logic: 
      even if "canWalljump" tech is enabled, the game logic will be overridden to not assume an ability to wall jump.
      </p>
      <p>With this setting you can still get a wall-jump check, but pressing jump during the check will not
      actually trigger a wall jump.</p>
      <p><b>Note</b>: The logic without wall jumps is not yet thoroughly tested, so it is possible you may encounter a bug
      where a seed could be unbeatable due to the logic mistakenly assuming you can wall jump. If you think you may have
      encountered such a seed, please let us know in the <a href="https://discord.gg/Gc99YV2ZcB">Discord</a>.
