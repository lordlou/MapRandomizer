      If enabled, Samus will start the game at a random place on the map instead of at the Ship. Samus will not be able 
      to save or refill at the starting location. The player will need to find the Ship in order to complete the
      escape sequence.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Details</b>: The logic ensures a pathway exists from the starting 
      location to some "hub" room with enemies that can be defeated with Power Beam and which drop all types of 
      resources (energy, Missiles, Supers, and Power Bombs). The logic follows certain rules with respect to
      this hub room (similar to how the Ship is treated when not using randomized start):
      <ul>
      <li>There is always a path from the starting room to the hub and back without needing to collect items.
      <li>Items are only in logic once there is a path to the item and back to the hub without using the item.
      <li>The hub room is shown as the starting and ending point of routes in the spoiler map.
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>Currently, even when this option is enabled, Landing Site (containing the Ship) is still always in Crateria, 
      though that will likely change in a future version of the randomizer.</p>
