        <p>These settings affect how the randomizer prioritizes placing key items, which can be used to nudge the randomizer to try
        to place certain items earlier or later on average. Wide variation should still be expected in the results, because of
        constraints that limit how early or late the randomizer can place a key item in any given situation, especially for lower
        settings of "Skill assumptions".</p>

        <h5>Details</h5>
        <p>At the beginning of each randomization attempt, an item priority order is determined by randomly shuffling all the 
        item types, with the constraint that "Early" items (as selected below) come before "Default" items, which in turn come
        before "Late" items. Every item type occurs somewhere in this priority order (even Missiles and other filler items). The same
        priority order is used across all steps of a given attempt.</p>
        
        <p>On a given step, the randomizer determines the quantity of key items to place based on the "Progression rate". It will 
        always begin by attempting to place the first available key item(s) from the priority order, along with randomly selected 
        filler items. If this combination of items provides progression, then the randomizer will accept this placement and move 
        on to the next step. Otherwise, the randomizer replaces the last key item with the next one in the priority order and tries again, 
        continuing this way until it either succeeds or all item types are exhausted (in which case it will try again with a new 
        map and new item priority order).
